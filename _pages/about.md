I am a doctoral student specializing in anthropological archaeology, with a focus on the socio-cultural interactions and complexities of ancient populations in eastern North America. My primary supervisor is Professor Jennifer Birch.

For my masterâ€™s degree in archaeology, I conducted a comparative macroscopic analysis of lithic (stone) raw materials from 79 archaeological sites in the Ottawa River Valley, the Laurentians, and the Upper Mauricie regions.
