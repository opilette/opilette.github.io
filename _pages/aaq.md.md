The [Association des archéologues du Québec/Association of Archaeologists](https://www.archeologie.qc.ca/) (AAQ) was founded in 1979. The association is a non-profit organization bringing together professional and trainee archaeologists whose expertise enables them to serve the general public, and in particular the individuals, institutions, organizations, and public institutions that may use their services. The AAQ is a key partner in the development of archaeological policies in Québec and plays an active role in the management and preservation of archaeological resources and heritage throughout Quebec.

The association publishes the peer-reviewed journal _Archéologiques_ once a year. It is the only fully specialized archaeology journal published in French in the Americas.

I'm currently the webmaster of the AAQ website.
